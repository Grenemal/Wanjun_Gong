abstract: Self-healing or self-repairing materials are ‘smart materials’ that repair damage caused by mechanical force and are a key development of 21st century materials chemistry and engineering. In this review we describe a few excellent examples of self-healing supramolecular polymers based on host-guest interactions and discuss their advantages and versatility.
