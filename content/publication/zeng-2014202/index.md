abstract: A Brønsted solid acid was prepared from waste coal fly ash by acid treatment with concentrated H2SO4 at 473 K. The prepared solid acid was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform Infrared spectra (FT-IR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characterization results show that the solid acid contains two types of Brønsted acid sites, weak acidic –OH groups and strong bridging Si–O(H)–Al groups. The acid strength of the strong acid sites is similar to that of zeolite HY (Si/Al = 3). The solid acid from fly ash exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability in methanol dehydration reaction for dimethyl ether (DME) production. Our finding is a promising way of utilization of waste coal fly ash to prepare effective solid acid catalyst for industrial acid catalysis reactions.
