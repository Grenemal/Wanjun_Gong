abstract: The microviscosity change associated with reticulophagy is an important component for studying endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress disorders. Here, a BODIPY-arsenicate conjugate 1-based fluorescent molecular rotor was designed to covalently bind vicinal dithiol-containing proteins in the ER, exhibiting a bifunction of reticulophagy initiation and microviscosity evaluation. Therefore, we could quantify the local viscosity changes during reticulophagy based on the fluorescence lifetime changes of probe 1.
