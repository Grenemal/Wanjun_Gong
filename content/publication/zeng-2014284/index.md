abstract: A strong Brønsted solid acid was synthesized by sulfonation of the partially carbonized agricultural biowaste peanut shell. The acidity of the Brønsted solid acid was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The characterization results show that sulfonation on the peanut shell carbon produces a carbon based solid acid containing three functional Brønsted acid sites, weak acidic single bondOH groups, strong acidic single bondCOOH and single bondSO3H groups. The acid strength of the solid acid is stronger than that of HZSM-5(Si/Al = 75), but still weaker than that of 100% H2SO4. The catalytic reaction tests indicate that this solid acid catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent recyclability for biodiesel production.
