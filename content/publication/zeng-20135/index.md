abstract: A novel solid acid was prepared from petroleum coke by KOH chemical activation and concentrated H2SO4 sulfonation. The solid acid was characterized by XRD, FT-IR and solid-state NMR. The characterization results show that the chemical activation and sulfonation lead to three functional Brønsted acid sites, –OH, –COOH and –SO3H on the solid acid. The probe molecules experimental reveal that the acid strength of the solid acid is stronger than that of SO42− /ZrO2, but slightly weaker than that of 100% H2SO4. The catalytic performance was evaluated by the esterification of oleic acid with methanol. The results indicate that this solid acid catalyst is very active, corresponding to high conversion (72%) of esterification reaction. In addition, the spent solid acid can be recovered by simple regeneration process.
