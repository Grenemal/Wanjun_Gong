abstract: The Pd-Su nanomedicine shows a high Su loading capacity (85 mg gâˆ’1), a high near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion efficiency (69.4%), and NIR-controlled H2S release by the photothermal-triggered hydrolysis of Su. The combination of photothermal heating and H2S produces a strong synergetic effect by H2S-induced inhibition of heat shock response, thereby effectively inhibiting tumor growth. Moreover, high intratumoral accumulation of the Pd-Su nanomedicine after intravenous injection also enables photothermal/photoacoustic dual-mode imaging-guided tumor treatment.
