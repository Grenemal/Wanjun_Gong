abstract: As an emerging field, gas therapy attracts increasing attention because of its distinguishing features in disease treatment. However, to achieve a therapeutic effect, the concentration of gas should be carefully controlled. Thus, a suitable and convenient technology is required to monitor the gas concentration in vivo. Besides, the transportation of gas into human body and in vivo biodistribution of gas also need to be evaluated. Among the technologies adopted in gas therapy, fluorescence imaging technology is the first choice due to its high specificity, high sensitivity, and non-invasion. And as the core of fluorescence imaging, the properties of fluorescent dyes directly determine the quality of imaging. So, it is critical to choose suitable gas probes for different purposes. Here, we review common gas detection methods, including a brief introduction of fluorescence, the distinctive properties of five fluorophore cores, and the detection mechanisms of common gas probes. Then, the applications of gas probes in gas delivery, gas release, and gas therapy are summarized. At last, we discuss the potential of developing further intelligent gas probes and fluorescence imaging technologies for gas therapy.
